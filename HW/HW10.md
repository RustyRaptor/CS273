# HW 10 CS 273 Ziad Arafat

1. If the input clock source operates at 16 MHz, what is the TCNT1 value needed to generate a time delay of 0.5 millisecond in normal mode?
   - 16, 000, 000 clk/sec * 0.0005sec = 8000clk
   - 2^16 - 8000 = 0xE0C0

2. If the clock operates at 10 MHz, what is the OCR0 value needed to generate time delay of 4 microseconds in CTC mode without any prescaler.
   - 10 million clocks/sec 0.000004 seconds 
   - 40 clocks
   - Value of 39


3. Write an assembly program for Timer1 to generate a square wave of 16000 Hz to output on PB3 using a clock frequency of 16 MHz.

```
16 million clk/sec = 16000 clks/sec * n
n = 1000
1000/2 = 500
500 off
500 on
```

```
sbi ddrb, 5  // pb5 as an output
start:
     sbi portb, 3  // pb3 = 1
     rcall  500delay
     cbi portb, 3  // pb3 = 0
     rcall  500delay
     jmp  start


500delay:
     ldi r20, 0x01
     out tcnt1h, r20  // temp = 0xd8
     ldi r20, 0xf8
     out tcnt1l, r20  // tcnt1l = 0xf0, tcnt1h = temp
     ldi r20, 0x0
     out tccr1a, r20  // wgm11:10=00
     ldi r20, 0x1
     out tccr1b, r20  // wgm13:12=00, cs=clk
loop:
     in r20, tifr1  // read tifr1
     sbrs r20, tov1  // if tov1 is set skip next instruction
     jmp loop
     ldi r20, 1<<tov1 
     out tifr1, r20  // clear tov1 flag
     ldi r19, 0
     out tccr1b, r19  // stop timer
     out tccr1a, r19  // 

ret
```

4.  What is the advantage of using falling/rising edges instead of high/low voltages to detect events?
     - So we can catch an event we are listening for. If we only look at 2 values we might not catch it. 

5. What is the signal the following code generates at PORTB pin 5? If it is a periodical signal, what is its period? The clock frequency is 16MHz.

```
0x100 - 3B = 256 - 59 = 197 = 210 clks off and 210 clks on
420 clks ;; nice
```
