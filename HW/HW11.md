# CS 273 HW 11 - Ziad Arafat

1. **The addresses are.**
     - TCNT0  = 0x26 (0x46)
     - TCCR0A = 0x24 (0x44)
     - TCCR0B = 0x25 (0x45)
     - OCR0A  = 0x27 (0x47)
     - OCR0B  = 0x28 (0x48)
     - TIMSK0 = (0x6E)
     - TCNT1H = (0x85)
     - TCNT1L = (0x84)
     - TCCR1A = (0x80)
     - TCCR1B = (0x81)
     - TCCR1C = (0x82)
     - OCR1AH = (0x89)
     - OCR1AL = (0x88)
     - OCR1BH = (0x8B)
     - OCR1BL = (0x8A)
     - TIMSK1 = (0x6F)
     - TCNT2  = (0xB2)
     - TCCR2A = (0xB0)
     - TCCR2B = (0xB1)
     - OCR2A  = (0xB3)
     - OCR2B  = (0xB4)
     - TIMSK2 = (0x70)

2.  **Read Section 14 Interrupts and Timers of the booklet and answer the following questions.**
    1.  We can utilize resources more efficiently so our CPU doesn't have to constantly listen for a signal. Instead we offload it to a dedicated device. 
    2.  An array of addresses indicating the address of the code that should be executed corresponding to an interrupt signal. 
    3.  Because we need to ensure that none of the registers have changed in the meantime. 
    4.  CODE:

**C Code**

```c
#include "avr/io.h"
#include "avr/interrupt.h"

void isr(vector) {
     byte *a = 0x200;
     byte *b = 0x201;

     if (*a == 255) {
          *a = 0;
          *b++;
     } else{
          *a++;
     }
}
```

**ASM code**
```avrasm
timer2b:
     push r20
     in r20, sreg
     push r20
     push r21 
     clr r21

     lds r20, 0x200
     inc r20
     sts 0x200, r20
     lds r20, 0x201
     adc r20, r21
     sts 0x201, r20

     pop r21
     pop r20
     out sreg, r20
     pop r20
```
